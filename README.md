# Tray Racer: A simple curved-space ray tracer

The aim of this project is to render a simple wormhole by ray-tracing
the curved rays through it. No fancy physics, no geometry, just a
couple of environment maps on each side, but hopefully enough to give
you the idea.

Based on the maths discussed in
https://github.com/simon-frankau/curved-spaces/ .

## TODO

At this stage, everything!
